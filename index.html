                             <p>I see myself as an artist who loves technology. Poetry's a natural language for me.
                                For me, encoding is a way of communicating,
                                a way to make my voice heard.<br>
                                Translating ideas and feelings to websites is something
                                I fell in love with it as soon as I coded my own website.
                                Now I start my journey in the world of web development and it's AMAZING.</p>
                             <p> Keeping things simple is the mantra that I practice on a daily basis.
                                So I feel comfortable applying that concept in the way I code.
                                Simplicity is beauty for me. That's why
                                I use my skills to write <span>simple and beautiful code.</span>
